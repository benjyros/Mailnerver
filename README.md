# Mailnerver
This is a program to spam certain people with emails.

The .jar files under "jar_files" are required for the program.

In addition, your device should not be connected to the Internet via a LAN cable.
This could possibly result in the email not being sent.

The project cannot be imported into NetBeans. This program was
implemented, run and tested with Visual Studio Code.
